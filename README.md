CSE 291B: Big Data Science and Knowledge project

# Problem
First we aim to tackle the Covid v/s Non-Covid classification problem using merged metabolomic and proteomics features (unmod and variant peptides). 

# Plan
We do not aim to develop the best performing model in terms of popular classification metrics, but rather focus on the explainability of the model and the data that we are using.
